# Iris-Flower-Classification
Hello Visitor!!!!!!

\* This project classifies three different species of Iris flower and develop a machine learning model to predict the type of species just by getting some details(sepal length, sepal width, colour). Tools that helped me in completing these tasks are Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib. */
*****I have also attached the dataset for you reference.*****
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
their species, and here my task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the
measurements of the iris species and classify them.



Although the Scikit-learn library provides a dataset for iris flower classification, you can also
download the same dataset from here for the task of iris flower classification with Machine
Learning.
